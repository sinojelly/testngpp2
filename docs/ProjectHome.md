**TestNG++** is a practical, easy-to-use next generation C/C++ xUnit framework.

C/C++ are different languages from most modern ones. Writing tests for them has some very specific challenges. Therefore, simply clone ideas from xUnit frameworks for other languages does not work the best. Programmers have to suffer accidental complexities brought by most of existing frameworks.

**TestNG++** is designed for simplifying efforts of programers, in terms of development, maintenance, flexibility of test management, build & run-time strategy, and others.
